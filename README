Ti-touches
==========

Appcelerator Titanium touch events example project.
On branch master is a solution with convertPointToView();
on branch sensor-mask, a solution with a transparent view as global touch sensor.

Connects the blue box to the red box with touch and finger slide. 
The windows backgroundColor and the Label will give action feedback to the user.
The blue box is not going to move anywhere. For now.
